## STEP 1 

I downloaded Vercel (a frontend developer tool) in which i joined my github account in order to create a Vercel account and to deploy my website.

Once my website is deployed, in the deployments tab on Vercel, i activated the Checkly feature in the "Running Checks" tab. For verify that i installed Check 

## STEP 3

Using github actions, i found an extension call imgbot in the github marketplace, and i activated it on my portfolio repo. I did a git cimmit and push to verificated and i found two branches : the main branch and the imgbot branch.

After this, i wanted to share my work on discord so i use zapier to connect my github account to my discord. To do this, you have to install zapier and i zaped my github to my discord account. i created a specific discord server to implement my bot here is the link : https://discord.gg/ku3YfnPW
